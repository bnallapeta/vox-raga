# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Service Implementation Guide

## Project Overview

### Vision
Create a modular, scalable, and high-performance speech-to-speech translation pipeline that can operate in both cloud and edge environments. The system will convert spoken language from one language to another in near real-time with high accuracy and natural-sounding output.

### Complete Pipeline Components
The pipeline consists of three independent but interconnected services:

1. **Speech-to-Text (ASR)** - Kube-Whisperer
   * Converts spoken audio into text
   * Uses OpenAI's Whisper models with various size options
   * Handles multiple audio formats and languages

2. **Text Translation** - Translation Service
   * Translates text from source to target language
   * Uses NLLB-200 models with various size options
   * Supports 100+ languages with high accuracy

3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** - This Service
   * Converts translated text into natural-sounding speech
   * Uses Coqui TTS with multi-language, multi-speaker support
   * Provides voice customization and emotion control

### Pipeline Flow
1. User submits audio in language A
2. Kube-Whisperer converts audio to text in language A
3. Translation Service converts text from language A to language B
4. TTS Service converts text in language B to audio in language B
5. User receives audio in language B

### Key Features of TTS Service
- High-quality, natural-sounding speech synthesis
- Support for 40+ languages
- Multiple voice options per language
- Adjustable speech parameters (speed, pitch, etc.)
- Emotion and style control
- REST and WebSocket APIs
- Kubernetes-native deployment
- Scalable architecture

### Technical Architecture
- Microservices architecture with each component as an independent service
- Kubernetes-native deployment
- FastAPI for all service APIs
- Docker containers for packaging
- Prometheus for metrics
- Structured logging
- GPU acceleration with CPU fallback
- Multi-architecture support (AMD64/ARM64)
