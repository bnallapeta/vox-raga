# P0 Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the P0 tasks from the next-steps.md guide.

## Cleaned Up Legacy Docker Files

- Removed old Docker-related files:
  - Dockerfile, Dockerfile.simple, Dockerfile.minimalist
  - entrypoint.sh, fixed-entrypoint.sh
  - patch_tts.py, fix-tts-patch.py
  - setup_models.py and other helper scripts

## Implemented P0 Basic Dockerfile

Created new Dockerfiles based on the Coqui TTS images with the following improvements:
- Used the official Coqui TTS base images (CPU and GPU versions)
- Set up proper working directories for models and cache
- Added a non-root user for better security
- Added health checks for Kubernetes readiness/liveness probes
- Set Python optimization flags for better performance
- Added cross-platform build support using Docker buildx

## Updated TTSModelManager for Coqui TTS Integration

Modified the TTSModelManager class to better integrate with Coqui TTS:
- Added `get_model_paths` method to look for models in multiple locations
- Implemented a new `load_model` method that checks both our app's model paths and Coqui's model paths
- Added fallback mechanism to use Coqui's built-in model loading capabilities
- Improved error handling and logging for model loading failures

## Updated Configuration

Updated the application's configuration to match the Docker setup:
- Changed default model download path to `/app/models`
- Set default server port to 8888
- Changed cache directory to `/app/cache`
- Made sure environment variables can override these defaults
- Added device configuration (CPU/GPU) support

## Created Kubernetes Deployment Resources

Implemented Kubernetes deployment resources:
- Created separate Deployment resources for CPU and GPU usage
- Added PersistentVolumeClaim for models (5Gi)
- Added PersistentVolumeClaim for cache (1Gi)
- Added an init container to ensure proper volume permissions
- Added proper resource requests and limits
- Set up proper environment variables
- Created a Service to expose the deployment
- Added optional node affinity configurations for GPU/CPU nodes

## Cross-Platform and Multi-Architecture Support

Added support for building and deploying across different architectures:
- Created separate Dockerfiles for CPU and GPU versions
- Updated Makefile to use Docker buildx for cross-platform builds
- Added specific targets for building AMD64 images from ARM64 Macs
- Added documentation for cross-architecture builds and deployments
- Configured Kubernetes deployments for different hardware environments

## Documentation

Added documentation:
- Created README-docker.md with instructions for building and deploying
- Added environment variable documentation
- Added API usage examples
- Added troubleshooting tips
- Added instructions for multi-architecture builds

## Other Improvements

- Updated the Makefile with cross-platform build commands
- Set up health check endpoints for Kubernetes probes
- Updated the requirements.txt to match the Coqui TTS version (0.22.0)
